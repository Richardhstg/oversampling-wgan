# oversampling-wgan

Oversampling with Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) is a technique used in imbalanced datasets to generate synthetic samples for the minority class, improving the modelâ€™s performance on underrepresented classes. In traditional oversampling, methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) create synthetic data points by interpolating between existing minority samples. However, for complex data distributions, especially in high-dimensional data, GANs can generate more realistic synthetic samples by learning the underlying data distribution.
